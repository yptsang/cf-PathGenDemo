a. Thank you for your interest in this project. 
    This is an example of using the RRT algorithm to generate a collision-free path.
    Part of the code we provided was referenced from the website: https://blog.csdn.net/gentleman597/article/details/124543703
b. The above code must be run on Matlab platform with Matlab 2022a or higher version. (All code tested in Matlab 2025b).
c. Running the RRT-Main.m file can output a collision-free path.
d. The ObsCoor (obstacle coordinate) matrix can be revised according to the required flight space.
e. After generating the complete trajectory, a specified number of evaluation nodes can be generated using spline function to assess the safety risk cost of noise along the entire path. (The usage of spline function can refer to the website: https://ww2.mathworks.cn/help/matlab/ref/spline.html)

The above codes are applied in part of the below work:
